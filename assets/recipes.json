    "steps":
      "Preheat oven to 425Â°F.\nCut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard.\nWith a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears (this keeps the asparagus from being all.\",string.\", and if you eat asparagus you know what I mean by that).\nPlace asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.\nSprinkle with salt.\nWith your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.\nRoast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.\nThey should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife \n The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning.\nThey are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.",
